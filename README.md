To run code make sure to download the bendlabs driver "ads_driver" and put into the arduino library.
The driver can be found at https://github.com/bendlabs/one_axis_ads.
Copy the library/ads_driver into your local Arduino/library folder.
Modify the ads_driver/ads.h file by changing the command ADS_DFU_CHECK(1) to ADS_DFU_CHECK(0)
